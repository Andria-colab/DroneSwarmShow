# Drone Swarm Simulation 

A physics-based simulation of a massive drone swarm (1000 drones) performing formation control, complex transitions, and dynamic target tracking.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a swarm of quadcopters using **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** and **Potential Fields**.
The simulation enforces realistic physics constraints including maximum velocity, collision avoidance (repulsion), and smooth damping.

The project demonstrates three distinct capabilities:
1.  **Task 1: Formation Control** - Drones autonomously organize to form a static shape (a name) from an image input.
2.  **Task 2: Transition Flight** - The swarm smoothly transitions from the first formation into a new text formation ("Happy New Year!").
3.  **Task 3: Dynamic Tracking** - The swarm tracks a moving target (a figure-8 pattern) in real-time based on computer vision analysis of a video feed.

## Technologies Used
* **Python 3.10+**
* **NumPy:** High-performance vectorized physics calculations (forces, distances, velocities).
* **OpenCV (cv2):** Image processing and background subtraction for target extraction.
* **Matplotlib:** 3D and 2D visualization and animation.
* **Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4):** High-precision numerical integration solver for stability.
